# OmniLink Protocol

## Action Naming
Satellite apps must never define their own action starting with `_`. The `_` prefix is reserved for protocol-level system calls (e.g. the heartbeat tick, `_tick`). This keeps a clean namespace between "the protocol talking to itself" and "the agent calling app-specific capabilities," with no new AIDL method required to add future system-level calls.

## OS-Level Security & Constants
The SDK defines the following constants in `OmniLinkConstants` which should be used by both Workspace and satellite extensions:
- `OmniLinkConstants.PERMISSION_BIND_EXTENSION` (`com.omnilink.sdk.permission.BIND_EXTENSION`): A `signature` level permission. Android will reject any `bindService()` call if the caller does not hold this permission and isn't signed with the same key. The SDK merges this automatically into consumer manifests.
- `OmniLinkConstants.ACTION_EXTENSION_BIND` (`com.omnilink.sdk.action.EXTENSION_BIND`): The intent action used to discover and bind extensions.

**Note:** The OS-level permission is the primary defense, but a `SecurityValidator` (specifically `SignatureSecurityValidator`) is a required second layer of defense, not optional. Every consumer's `ExtensionService` subclass must set a real `SecurityValidator` to protect against package spoofing on rooted devices. Do not leave it as `null`.

## Execution: Sync vs. Async
**`executeAction` is reserved for actions a consumer explicitly documents as fast/non-blocking in its own manifest; anything else must be called via `executeActionAsync`.**

- `executeAction` is a synchronous AIDL method. It blocks the caller's thread and occupies one of the callee's finite binder-pool threads for the duration of the execution. This is risky for network, DB, or file I/O operations and can lead to thread exhaustion or ANRs.
- `executeActionAsync` is a `oneway` AIDL method that returns immediately and streams the outcome back via `IOmniResultCallback`. All standard heavy processing must use this path.

## The `requiresConfirmation` Flow
The protocol handles operations requiring explicit user confirmation in a strictly defined way.

- **Primary mechanism (Client-side):** The caller (Workspace) checks `CapabilityDescriptor.requiresConfirmation` from the extension's *cached manifest* **before** making the call. If true, the caller is responsible for displaying the confirmation UI and only executing the action if the user approves.
- **Server-side Fallback (Not a retry protocol):** If a remote extension's `AccessController` returns `AccessDecision.REQUIRES_CONFIRMATION` (e.g., due to a stale cache or dynamic runtime policy), the caller receives `ActionOutcome.RequiresConfirmation(...)`. The caller must treat this as a **hard abort** and surface the failure to the agent/user. The caller must **never** silently retry the call assuming implicit confirmation.

## Launcher Interface
The SDK repo defines the `IOmniLauncherInterface` AIDL as the single source of truth for the launcher IPC contract. However, the Omni-launcher repo does **not** take a direct dependency on this SDK. Instead, it copies the `.aidl` file text directly. The actual implementation (the Service and Binder stub) lives exclusively in the Omni-launcher repo, mapping these calls to Lawnchair/Launcher3 internals.

## Binder Transaction Size Limits
The shared Binder transaction buffer is a fixed ~1MB per process (covering all in-flight calls on the thread pool, not just the current one). Any capability that could return an unbounded list — a broad photo search, a large notes collection, a long price-history query — risks throwing `TransactionTooLargeException` and crashing the caller/service if it exceeds this threshold.

**Rule:** Every capability returning a list must either paginate (using a `limit`/`cursor`-style parameter) or hard-cap the result size defensively inside `onAction()`. They must never return an unbounded collection and hope it stays small in practice. If a result set exceeds reasonable limits, it should be capped, and the outcome should be cleanly handled (e.g., returning a capped list with a flag indicating truncation, or failing cleanly with a documented error code like `result_too_large`).

## Handling Remote Exceptions and Process Deaths
When making remote IPC calls across process boundaries, the target process/extension can crash, get killed by the Android OS low-memory killer (LMK), or die mid-call.

In such cases, the live call fails via an exception thrown directly out of the AIDL call itself (such as `DeadObjectException` or `RemoteException`). This is a completely separate failure path from the `onServiceDisconnected` callback.

**Rule:** Every remote call site must catch `RemoteException` and route the failure into the same reconnect-with-backoff path, rather than relying solely on the `onServiceDisconnected` callback firing separately. This ensures consistent recovery across all failure scenarios.

## Security: Data as Untrusted Input
The rule that external content is data, not commands, must be generalized beyond webpage scraping. The payment vault already treats webpage content the caller reads as untrusted data that the agent may reason about but must never obey as instructions.

**Rule:** Any data returned by any extension — including a note's body, a photo's metadata, a calendar event description, or an event payload — must be treated as untrusted data. Any of these sources could contain crafted text attempting an indirect prompt injection to redirect the agent's next action. Callers/Consumers must ensure that such returned data is only treated as data to be processed, and never treated as commands or instruction sources for the LLM agent.


## Agent Gateway (application → Workspace)

Trusted applications can chat with and delegate work to Omni without embedding another model runtime.
The canonical discovery action is `OmniLinkConstants.ACTION_AGENT_GATEWAY_BIND` and the service is guarded
by `OmniLinkConstants.PERMISSION_BIND_AGENT` (signature-level).

### Persistence contract

Every external task is a real Workspace conversation. Workspace owns the history row and persists:
- source application package and display name,
- stable client conversation id,
- topic/title,
- user and assistant messages,
- structured external context,
- Agent Console/tool execution entries,
- completion/error state.

A reconnecting client must reuse `clientConversationId` when it wants to continue the same conversation.

### Context is data, not authority

`AgentTaskRequest.context` may contain active-file text, diagnostics, Gradle output, project metadata,
selection/cursor data, or other application state. Workspace treats this as untrusted context. It can inform
reasoning but never overrides the system prompt, safety policy, tool policy, or confirmation policy.

### IDE/job rule

Builds, tests, lint, indexing and other long-running IDE operations are modeled as extension capabilities
with `CapabilityExecutionMode.JOB`. The action returns a job id quickly; progress and completion are emitted
as extension events or fetched by cursor. Large logs are paginated/chunked and never returned as one Binder
payload.
